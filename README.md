# Machine-Learning
Repositories for machine learning projects (jupyter notebooks)

- Classification
Holds projects which are based on classification. ranges from binary classification to mutiple class based projects.
Classifications algorithms are supervised helps us predict the groups of a selected object/thing.

- Clustering
Holds projects which are based on clustering. Clustering is a non-supervised machine learning techniques that can be used to create groups of related things,
and is also used to create a rules to divide object into relatable parts which can then be passed into classification for future occurences.

- NLP
Holds projects which are based on Natural Language Processing. NLP allows us interprete human languages and analze them. Used in applications like review systems,
sentiment analysis systems, virtual assistants and so on.

- Regression
Holds projects which are based on regression analysis. For continuous value prediction and analysis. Ranges to time series analysis and forecasting.
Regression algorithms are supervised and helps to forecast an dpredict continuous values.
